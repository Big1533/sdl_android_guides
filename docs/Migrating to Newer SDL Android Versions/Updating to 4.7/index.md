### Audio Streaming

With the addition of the `AudioStreamingManager`, which is accessed through `SdlManager`, you can now use `mp3` files in addition to `raw`. The `AudioStreamingManager` also handles `AudioStreamingCapabilities` for you, so your stream will use the correct capabilities for the connected head unit. We suggest that for any audio streaming that this is now used. For a full code example, please see the [Audio Streaming Guides](/guides/android/mobile-navigation/audio-streaming/)
