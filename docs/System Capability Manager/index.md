# System Capability Manager

The System Capability Manager was built as a tool for developers to easily request a capability (ie. NAVIGATION, VIDEO_STREAMING) without the need to use multiple methods. It also alleviates the need to individually cache results that come in the Register App Interface response, or from other areas.
