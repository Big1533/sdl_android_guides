## Overview

Sdl Java Suite is a suite of libraries that are written in Java to help developers make sdl enabled apps that can communicate with sdl head units. The suite can be integrated with Android, JavaSE(Embedded), and JavaEE(cloud) apps. The way developers can initially integrate Sdl libraries into their apps is slightly different from one platform to another. However, most other logic to communicate with the head unit is the same among all platforms. 

### Getting Started
The guides will walk you through the process of integrating Sdl into your app based on which platform your app runs on:

#### Android
To integrate Sdl into your Android app, please follow the steps in [Getting Started With Android](Getting Started With Android/Installation) section.

#### JavaSE (Embedded)
To integrate Sdl into your embedded Java app, please follow the steps in [Getting Started With JavaSE](Getting Started With JavaSE/Installation) section.

#### JavaEE (Cloud)
To integrate Sdl into your cloud Java app, please follow the steps in [Getting Started With JavaEE](Getting Started With JavaEE/Installation) section.

### Using Other Sdl Features
Features that are not under `Getting Started` sections are applicable to all platforms unless it noted otherwise. For example, the Android code that developers can use to display information on the head unit's screen in [Displaying Information](Displaying Information/Designing the User Interface) section, can be used also in embedded and cloud apps without any change needed.
